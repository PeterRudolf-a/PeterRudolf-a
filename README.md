## Hello!

I am a aspiring full stack developer. I have recently finished the University of Toronto's Coding Bootcamp, and I graduated from Durham College in the Computer Programmer and Analysis course. I am looking forward to learning more about coding, and developing my skills. I am dedicated to identifying needs and delivering effective solutions to all problems. I am currently looking for a full-time position in the field of software development. I am a quick learner, and I am always looking to improve my skills.
